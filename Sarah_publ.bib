  abstract = {Purpose The standardized `Tea Bag Index' enables comparisons of litter decomposition rates, a key component of carbon cycling, across ecosystems. However, tea `litter' may leach more than other plant litter, skewing comparisons of decomposition rates between sites with differing moisture conditions. Therefore, some researchers leach tea bags before field incubation. This decreases comparability between studies, and it is unclear if this modification is necessary.},

Climate warming may stimulate ecosystem respiration and release carbon into the atmosphere               3,4               . The magnitude and persistency of this stimulation and the environmental mechanisms that drive its variation remain uncertain               5--7               . This hampers the accuracy of global land carbon--climate feedback projections               7,8               . Here we synthesize 136 datasets from 56 open-top chamber in situ warming experiments located at 28 arctic and alpine tundra sites which have been running for less than 1\,year up to 25\,years. We show that a mean rise of 1.4\,{$^\circ$}C [confidence interval (CI) 0.9--2.0\,{$^\circ$}C] in air and 0.4\,{$^\circ$}C [CI 0.2--0.7\,{$^\circ$}C] in soil temperature results in an increase in growing season ecosystem respiration by 30\% [CI 22--38\%] (               n               \,=\,136). Our findings indicate that the stimulation of ecosystem respiration was due to increases in both plant-related and microbial respiration (               n               \,=\,9) and continued for at least 25\,years (               n               \,=\,136). The magnitude of the warming effects on respiration was driven by variation in warming-induced changes in local soil conditions, that is, changes in total nitrogen concentration and pH and by context-dependent spatial variation in these conditions, in particular total nitrogen concentration and the carbon:nitrogen ratio. Tundra sites with stronger nitrogen limitations and sites in which warming had stimulated plant and microbial nutrient turnover seemed particularly sensitive in their respiration response to warming. The results highlight the importance of local soil conditions and warming-induced changes therein for future climatic impacts on respiration.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Plant roots influence many ecological and biogeochemical processes, such as carbon, water and nutrient cycling. Because of difficult accessibility, knowledge on plant root growth dynamics in field conditions, however, is fragmentary at best. Minirhizotrons, i.e. transparent tubes placed in the substrate into which specialized cameras or circular scanners are inserted, facilitate the capture of high-resolution images of root dynamics at the soil-tube interface with little to no disturbance after the initial installation. Their use, especially in field studies with multiple species and heterogeneous substrates, though, is limited by the amount of work that subsequent manual tracing of roots in the images requires. Furthermore, the reproducibility and objectivity of manual root detection is questionable. Here, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the automatic detection of roots in minirhizotron images and compare the performance of our RootDetector with human analysts with different levels of expertise. Our minirhizotron data come from various wetlands on organic soils, i.e. highly heterogeneous substrates consisting of dead plant material, often times mainly roots, in various degrees of decomposition. This may be seen as one of the most challenging soil types for root segmentation in minirhizotron images. RootDetector showed a high capability to correctly segment root pixels in minirhizotron images from field observations (F1\,=\,0.6044; r               2               compared to a human expert\,=\,0.99). Reproducibility among humans, however, depended strongly on expertise level, with novices showing drastic variation among individual analysts and annotating on average more than 13-times higher root length/cm               2               per image compared to expert analysts. CNNs such as RootDetector provide a reliable and efficient method for the detection of roots and root length in minirhizotron images even from challenging field conditions. Analyses with RootDetector thus save resources, are reproducible and objective, and are as accurate as manual analyses performed by human experts.},

  abstract = {Empirical studies worldwide show that warming has variable effects on plant litter decomposition, leaving the overall impact of climate change on decomposition uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis of 109 experimental warming studies across seven continents, using natural and standardised plant material, to assess the overarching effect of warming on litter decomposition and identify potential moderating factors. We determined that at least 5.2{$^\circ$} of warming is required for a significant increase in decomposition. Overall, warming did not have a significant effect on decomposition at a global scale. However, we found that warming reduced decomposition in warmer, low-moisture areas, while it slightly increased decomposition in colder regions, although this increase was not significant. This is particularly relevant given the past decade's global warming trend at higher latitudes where a large proportion of terrestrial carbon is stored. Future changes in vegetation towards plants with lower litter quality, which we show were likely to be more sensitive to warming, could increase carbon release and reduce the amount of organic matter building up in the soil. Our findings highlight how the interplay between warming, environmental conditions, and litter characteristics improves predictions of warming's impact on ecosystem processes, emphasising the importance of considering context-specific factors.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background and aims               Forest peatlands represent 25\% of global peatlands and store large amounts of carbon (C) as peat. Traditionally they have been drained in order to increase forestry yield, which may cause large losses of C from the peat. Rewetting aims to stop these losses and to restore the initial storage function of the peatlands. As roots represent major peat forming elements in these systems, we sampled roots \&lt;5~mm in a drained and a rewetted forest peatland in NE Germany to evaluate differences in tree biomass investments belowground, root functional characteristics and root age.                                         Methods               We cored soil next to Alnus glutinosa stems and sorted root biomass into \&lt;1~mm, 1--2~mm, and 2--5~mm diameter classes. We measured biomass distribution and specific root area (SRA) in 10 cm-depth increments down to 50~cm, and estimated root age from annual growth rings.                                         Key Results               Root biomass in the rewetted site was more than double that of the drained site. This difference was mostly driven by very fine roots \&lt;1~mm, which accounted for 51\% of the total root biomass and were mostly (75\%) located in the upper 20~cm. For roots \&lt;1~mm, SRA did not differ between the sites. However, SRA of the 1-2~mm and 2-5~mm diameter roots was higher in the drained than in the rewetted site. Root age did not differ between sites.                                         Conclusions               The size-dependent opposite patterns between root biomass and their functional characteristics under contrasting water regimes indicate differences between fine and coarse roots in their response to environmental changes. Root age distribution points to similar root turnover rates between the sites, while higher root biomass in the rewetted site clearly indicates larger tree C stocks belowground under rewetting, supporting the C sink function of the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Peatlands are effective carbon sinks as more biomass is produced than decomposed under the prevalent anoxic conditions. Draining peatlands coupled with warming releases stored carbon, and subsequent rewetting may or may not restore the original carbon sink. Yet, patterns of plant production and decomposition in rewetted peatlands and how they compare to drained conditions remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured annual above- and belowground biomass production and decomposition in three different drained and rewetted peatland types: alder forest, percolation fen and coastal fen during an exceptionally dry year. We also used standard plant material to compare decomposition between the sites, regardless of the decomposability of the local plant material. Rewetted sites showed higher root and shoot production in the percolation fen and higher root production in the coastal fen, but similar root and leaf production in the alder forest. Decomposition rates were generally similar in drained and rewetted sites, only in the percolation fen and alder forest did aboveground litter decompose faster in the drained sites. The rewetted percolation fen and the two coastal sites had the highest projected potential for organic matter accumulation. Roots accounted for 23--66\% of total biomass production, and belowground biomass, rather than aboveground biomass, was particularly important for organic matter accumulation in the coastal fens. This highlights the significance of roots as main peat-forming element in these graminoid-dominated fen peatlands and their crucial role in carbon cycling, and shows that high biomass production supported the peatlands' function as carbon sink even during a dry year.},
