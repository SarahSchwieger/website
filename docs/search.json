    "text": "This project focuses on the effect of warming on root compared to leaf decomposition across shrub and graminoids vegetation to address the hypothesis that:\n\nWarming will cause a larger relative increase in root litter decomposition than in leaf litter decomposition. While shrub root litter will decompose at a slower rate than graminoid root litter, its sensitivity to warming will be higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use a coordinated distributed experiment (CDE) across the Arctic to study how warming affects shrub root and leaf decomposition. Open-top chambers (OTCs) will artificially increase temperature at multiple tundra sites within the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) network. Standardized protocols for litter bag deployment and data collection will ensure consistent comparisons across sites.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project focuses on how climate-driven expansion of dwarf shrubs affects root decomposition across climatic gradients and from existing grasslands to emerging shrub heathlands. My hypothesis is that:\n\nDwarf shrub root litter transplanted from wetter and colder to drier and warmer environments will decompose faster than established litter at the warmer sites. However, introducing ‘new’ shrub litter to existing grassland vegetation will slow its decomposition. This difference may stem from the transplanted litter’s chemical composition being more readily degradable by the microbial community in warmer conditions, and local decomposers potentially not being adapted to the more resistant shrub litter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project investigates how climate influences root litter decomposition using transplantation experiments across latitudinal and elevational gradients in Norway. We will move root litter from cold/wet sites to warm/dry sites to test for home-field advantage effects and assess decomposition rates in different vegetation types. This space-for-time substitution approach allows us to examine long-term ecological changes in a shorter timeframe.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "This project investigates the key factors influencing root decomposition in response to warming. I will compare the relative importance of litter quality (inherent characteristics) versus environmental conditions (location and soil depth) on decomposition rates under controlled conditions. I hypothesise that:\n\nUnder controlled conditions with a warmer temperature and moister soil conditions compared to a drier or cooler environment, the inherent litter quality (chemical composition) of dwarf shrub root litter will have a greater impact on decomposition rates dependent on the location of decomposition (on top of the soil, within the soil profile).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will set up controlled environment experiments in growth chambers at UMU and manipulate key environmental factors like temperature and moisture to isolate their effects. The chemical composition of root litter samples will be determined. These data will provide detailed information on litter quality. I will investigate root decomposition at different soil depths to understand how the decomposition environment influences decomposition processes and their response to warmer climates.\nBy comparing decomposition under controlled conditions and with varying litter quality, I can directly test the relative importance of these factors in driving root decomposition under warming.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Up to 80% of the plant biomass in the Arctic resides belowground in the form of roots, yet we know little of their role in ecosystem carbon dynamics. In particular, research on root decomposition lags behind our understanding of aboveground plant parts. This lack of knowledge is particularly concerning as shrub growth and expansion accelerate in the Arctic and alpine tundra due to warming temperatures. The impact of warmer temperatures on root decomposition in these shrub- dominated ecosystems remains virtually unknown.\nMy project will fill this gap by investigating the effects of climate warming on root decomposition in Arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems and in doing so will be a major step forward in understanding how these processes influence the dynamics of carbon and nutrient cycling. By combining different approaches, such as space-for-time substitution, coordinated, distributed experiments with experimental warming using open-top chambers at multiple tundra sites, and growth chamber experiments with controlled environmental conditions, I will gain valuable insights into the mechanisms controlling root decomposition in response to climate change. This knowledge will not only advance scientific understanding, but also will also benefit society by clarifying how shrubification affects carbon and nutrients, leading to better climate predictions and the development of effective mitigation strategies in Arctic and alpine regions facing rapid environmental change.\nUnderstanding the key drivers of decomposition under warming is crucial to predict the future of the Arctic nutrient and carbon cycle and its impact on global climate change. These drivers could be environmental (i.e., temperature and moisture) or inherent to the litter itself (i.e., chemical composition). Separating these influences is challenging, but by studying decomposition across various environmental conditions with controlled experiments, this project addresses this challenge.\nThis research will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the future trajectory of the Arctic carbon cycle and its broader implications for global climate change. For this purpose, I aim to answer the following research questions:\n\nDoes belowground litter (i.e., roots) decompose differently from aboveground litter (i.e., leaves) in response to warming, and does the decomposition of different plant functional types (i.e., shrubs and graminoids) respond similarly? Read more\nHow will increasing dwarf shrub cover due to climate change alter root decomposition rates across elevational and latitudinal gradients, considering the potential for local adaptation (including ‘home-field advantage’ effects) of these shrubs? Read more\nWhat factors drive root decomposition responses to warming? Specifically, do environmental conditions (e.g., decomposition above the soil surface or in the soil, different soil depths) or inherent litter characteristics (e.g., specific traits, chemical composition) play a more significant role?
