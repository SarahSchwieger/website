title: "Decomposition Responses to Warming"
---

This project focuses on the effect of warming on root compared to leaf decomposition across shrub and graminoids vegetation to address the hypothesis that:

> Warming will cause a larger relative increase in root litter decomposition than in leaf litter decomposition. While shrub root litter will decompose at a slower rate than graminoid root litter, its sensitivity to warming will be higher.

We will use a coordinated distributed experiment (CDE) across the Arctic to study how warming affects shrub root and leaf decomposition. Open-top chambers (OTCs) will artificially increase temperature at multiple tundra sites within the [International Tundra Experiment (ITEX)](https://www.gvsu.edu/itex/) network. Standardized protocols for litter bag deployment and data collection will ensure consistent comparisons across sites.
